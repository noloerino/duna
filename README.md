A 32-bit RISCV emulator built in Rust. Inspired by [Venus](https://github.com/ThaumicMekanism/venus).

## Roadmap - RV32I
- [ ] Support base ISA
- [ ] Simulate ecalls
- [ ] Support assembler [relocation functions](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-asm-manual/blob/master/riscv-asm.md#assembler-relocation-functions)
- [ ] Run [compliance tests](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-compliance)
- [ ] Provide debugger support a la GDB, possibly valgrind-like tools as well?
- [ ] Implement peephole optimizations + visualizations
